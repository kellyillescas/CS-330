Computer Graphics and Visualization

The new skills I have gained from work on this project are directly related to rendering graphics with shape, depth, animation and texture. 
Tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work if a project ever requires the use of OpenGL.

In designing software, I try and look closely at exactly what the project requires. In any project, the usersâ€™ needs must come first. I start by examining 
the needs of the user closely. I can then begin designing my software and incorporating my ideas into the program design. As I begin writing code, 
I must also begin testing to be sure that my code works from the start and that I eliminate any bugs I could miss if I wait too long. 
As this process is occurring, I will begin to get feedback from users/stakeholders to be sure that I am continuing on the right track with the development process. 
As a program slowly becomes a finished product, I will once again consult with any stakeholders and be sure the product is what is desired. 
I will then begin a final testing stage that uses both testers on my end, as well as end-user testing. When a program is deemed complete and is ready to launch, 
I know that my job is not complete. I must continually update and test the program as user needs and scalability change.

New development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene included the use of the GLEW and GLFW libraries. These libraries are amazing structures that can 
serve to create almost limitless ideas. By initializing these libraries, I was able to take simple triangles and turn them into 3D objects. I could give these 
objects depth, make them move, and assign texture to make them look more realistic. Iteration factors into development in that multiple objects can be rendered 
using a small amount of code with minor adjustments to position and texture. My approach to developing code evolved through the milestones by allowing me to build 
upon a small rendering. I made it more in depth, more detailed, and could add multiple objects.

Computer science can help me in reaching my goals. Computational graphics and visualizations were instrumental in giving me a whole new field to investigate. 
I was always curious about how graphics were rendered in games and other things but did not think I would have the chance to experiment with it at SNHU. 
It also gave me a brand new appreciation for graphic designers because it is much more difficult than I ever expected to create one small picture on a tiny screen.
